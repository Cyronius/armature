# Armature: Servo, accelerated with AI

Armature is an unofficial fork of [Servo](https://github.com/servo/servo) that uses AI to accelerate development of
the engine. It is built with an AI coding assistant (Claude Code), and progress is measured by
[web-platform-tests](https://web-platform-tests.org/) conformance. It is **not** affiliated with or endorsed by the
Servo project.

Servo's [AI usage policy](https://book.servo.org/policy/ai-usage.html) does not accept AI-generated contributions,
so this work is not intended for, and has not been sent to, upstream Servo.

## What has been done

- **WICG [Observable API](https://wicg.github.io/observable/)**, behind the `dom_observable_enabled` preference
  (off by default; enabled for the tests by `tests/wpt/meta/dom/observable/__dir__.ini`): `Observable`, `Subscriber`,
  `EventTarget.when()`, every operator, and `Observable.from()` for Observables, iterables, async iterables and
  promises. `tests/wpt/tests/dom/observable` went from 523 failing subtests to 1.
- **HTML reflecting attributes**: about 130 missing IDL attributes (table, table cell, row and column, heading and
  `body` colors, `ol`/`li`/`dl`, `embed`/`object`/`param`/`area`, frames, `marquee`, form controls, `meta.media`,
  `a.download`/`ping`, `enterKeyHint`, `inputMode` and more). The `html/dom/reflection-*` tests went from about
  5,300 failing subtests to about 85. The enumerated ARIA attributes (`ariaBusy`, `ariaLive`, ...) are behind the
  `dom_aria_enumerated_reflection_enabled` preference.
- **`ProcessingInstruction` attributes** (`getAttribute()`, `setAttribute()` and friends), behind the
  `dom_processing_instruction_attributes_enabled` preference: 140 failing subtests down to 26.
- **Events**: `DragEvent`, `DeviceMotionEvent` and `DeviceOrientationEvent` and their `createEvent()` aliases; the
  `<body>`/`<frameset>` window event-handler attributes now forward `onblur` and the frameset handlers.
- **MIME types**: Request and Response `blob()` keep non-ASCII MIME parameters, and navigation quotes parameters it
  re-parses (so `charset` is no longer lost). `mimesniff/mime-types/parsing` went from 1,916 failing subtests to 1,402.
- **[Popover API](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/popover.html)**, behind the `dom_popover_enabled`
  preference (off by default; enabled for the tests): the `popover` attribute (`auto`, `manual` and `hint`),
  `showPopover()`/`hidePopover()`/`togglePopover()`, `beforetoggle`/`toggle` events, `popovertarget` on buttons and
  inputs, light dismiss, nested popovers, and dialog and fullscreen integration. `html/semantics/popovers` went from
  3,902 failing subtests to 79. Pressing Escape now also closes dialogs and close watchers.
- **WebCrypto hybrid KEMs**: MLKEM768-P256 and MLKEM1024-P384, next to the existing MLKEM768-X25519. The
  `WebCryptoAPI/modern-algos` tests have no failures left (2,036 fixed).
- **Streams**: async iteration of `ReadableStream` (`for await`, `values()`) and `ReadableStream.from()`, built on new
  generic support for `async_iterable` declarations in the WebIDL code generator: 320 failing subtests down to 0.
- **`HTMLElement.draggable`** (323 subtests), **fractional `MouseEvent` coordinates** as CSSOM View specifies (433),
  and the current HTML rules for **valid custom element names** (113). Element names with code points above U+10FFF,
  such as most emoji, are no longer rejected.
- **Editing commands** (`document.execCommand`, behind Servo's `dom_exec_command_enabled` preference):
  `justifyCenter`/`justifyFull`/`justifyLeft`/`justifyRight`, `insertOrderedList`/`insertUnorderedList`, `outdent`,
  `formatBlock` and `insertHTML`, plus fixes to the shared editing algorithms (line-break visibility, splitting a
  parent, sublist normalization, the backColor/hiliteColor value override) and the `align` attribute of table sections,
  rows and cells. The `editing` tests went from 23,799 failing subtests to 15,304.
- **SVG image sizing**: SVG images get their natural width, height and ratio from the outermost `svg` element as SVG 2
  specifies, and `img.naturalWidth`/`naturalHeight` follow the default sizing rules. `naturalWidth-naturalHeight-width-height`
  went from 182 failing subtests to 0, and about 340 more pass in the image, background, sizing and SVG tests.
- **Vendored Stylo**: Stylo, Servo's CSS engine, is vendored in `third_party/stylo/` as an unmodified import plus a
  log of every Armature change (`third_party/stylo.md`), so changes can be ported to and from upstream Stylo.
  `./mach test-tidy` checks that the log matches the actual diff.
- **CSS features behind Stylo preferences**: Servo now exposes 65 of Stylo's own `layout.css.*` preferences (51 are on
  in experimental mode; the rest would reach unimplemented layout code). About 50 standard properties that Stylo
  built only for Firefox are enabled behind new preferences: scroll snapping, `scroll-margin`/`scroll-padding`,
  `scrollbar-gutter`, `overflow-anchor`, scroll and view timelines, the SVG presentation properties, `accent-color`,
  `print-color-adjust`, `image-orientation`, `contain-intrinsic-size`, `content-visibility`, `break-*`, column rules,
  `counter-set`, `margin-trim`, `resize`, `field-sizing`, `shape-*`, `offset-*` (motion path), `transform-box` and
  `text-decoration-skip-ink`. In layout, `scrollIntoView()` honours scroll margin and padding, `transform-box` works,
  the SVG properties are mapped from presentation attributes, and lists use the `list-item` counter (including
  `<ol start reversed>` and `<li value>`). Most of the others are parsed, computed, serialised and animated but not
  laid out. The previously run CSS tests have about 5,300 fewer failing subtests, and newly enabled parsing and
  animation directories add 6,807 passing subtests.
- **SVG documents and SVG scripts**: navigating to an `image/svg+xml` resource creates an SVG document (it used to
  be shown as an image inside an HTML page, with no DOM or scripts), and SVG `<script>` elements run, sharing the HTML
  script processing model (`SVGScriptElement`, `document.currentScript`). Of the 256 testharness tests written as
  `.svg` files, which all errored, 249 now complete, with about 1,300 passing subtests. SVG scripts inside inline
  `<svg>` in HTML documents run too. `svg` elements fire `load` once parsed (`<svg onload>`), and SVG `<image>`
  elements fetch their image and fire `load` or `error`.
- **Vendored html5ever**: the HTML parser is vendored in `third_party/html5ever/` with a change log
  (`third_party/html5ever.md`), checked by `./mach test-tidy` like the Stylo one. Its changes implement the
  parsing rules for SVG `script` end tags and self-closing `<script/>` in SVG, which upstream had not implemented,
  tell Servo about every element the parser closes, and give the `xmlns` attribute of inline SVG and MathML no
  prefix (it had the empty prefix, so its `name` was `":xmlns"`).
- **XML serialization**: `XMLSerializer`, `innerHTML` and `outerHTML` in XML documents, and the drawing of inline SVG
  now use an implementation of the [DOM Parsing](https://w3c.github.io/DOM-Parsing/#xml-serialization) XML
  serialization algorithm instead of xml5ever's serializer. It keeps namespaces with prefixes and `xmlns`
  declarations as the spec says, escapes attribute values (`<`, `>`, `"`, tabs and newlines), writes doctypes with
  their public and system IDs, and makes `innerHTML`/`outerHTML` throw `InvalidStateError` for markup that would not
  be well-formed. 48 failing subtests and 14 reftests now pass in `domparsing`, `html/syntax`, the
  `ProcessingInstruction` tests and the SVG tests, among them inline SVG `<image>` elements with `data:` URLs that
  contain `<`. Inline SVG `<use>` also follows `xlink:href`.
- **Vendored xml5ever**: the XML parser is vendored in `third_party/xml5ever/` with a change log
  (`third_party/xml5ever.md`), checked by `./mach test-tidy` like the other vendored copies. Parsed XML documents now
  keep their namespace declarations (`xmlns`, `xmlns:p`) as attributes, in source order, which fixes 10 more
  `XMLSerializer` subtests and 7 `Node.lookupPrefix()` subtests.
- `AbortController.abort()` now rethrows an exception from an abort algorithm, and `Document.contentType` returns only
  the essence.
- `./mach fmt` and the crown GC-rooting lint pass, and the tested directories have no unexpected results other than a
  few tests that also fail or are flaky on the unmodified tree.

## What has not been done

- One Observable subtest still fails: `when()` in a detached document, because ordinary event listeners still run in
  detached documents.
- 20 `ProcessingInstruction` subtests need the HTML parser to produce processing instructions (html5ever).
- The CDATA round-trip and `DOMParser` CDATA tests fail because the XML parser (xml5ever) turns CDATA sections into
  text: markup5ever's tree sink has no way to create a CDATA section.
- Four subtests (two in `XMLSerializer-serializeToString.html`, two doctype subtests in `xml-serialization.xhtml`)
  expect behaviour that the DOM Parsing spec changed in August 2026 and that Armature follows: a doctype ID that
  contains `"` is quoted with `'`, and an attribute keeps its own prefix when the element does not declare that
  prefix itself (an open web-platform-tests change updates the tests). One more expects a redundant `xmlns=""` to be
  kept, which the spec drops.
- About 1,200 `mimesniff` Blob/File subtests expect `new Blob([], {type})` to parse and re-serialise the type, which
  Servo does not do; about 190 more need header values with control characters, which Servo's header storage rejects.
- 79 popover subtests still fail: layout has no real top layer or `::backdrop` (open popovers are drawn as
  `position: fixed`), focus navigation into popovers is not implemented, and 6 tests contradict the spec.
- `TextEncoder.encodeInto()` and `TextDecoder` streaming into a `SharedArrayBuffer` (about 210 subtests) fail because
  Servo has no cross-origin isolation, so shared memory is off in every global.
- Not enabled from Stylo: anchor positioning, `@scope`, `@starting-style`, `@page` margin rules, custom media,
  `background-clip: text`/`border-area`, grid lanes, `random()`, tree-counting functions and a few more, because
  Servo's layout or CSSOM would panic on them; `size`, `page-orientation` and `page`, which need `@page` support.
  `resize` has no resize handles, and `Element.animate()` is missing, so many CSS animation subtests still fail.
- SVG documents are drawn by the same code as inline SVG, which handles `<use>` and nested images
  less well than drawing the file as an image did, so a few `.svg` reftests that used to pass now fail. It only
  draws `<image>` elements whose `href` is a `data:` URL. SVG `<style>` in SVG documents and SMIL animation are also
  missing.
- Many editing tests still fail: deleting across differently styled blocks, whitespace handling, and cases where the
  tests expect browser behaviour that differs from the editing spec (Armature follows the spec). `formatBlock` and
  `insertHTML` are disabled in `contenteditable=plaintext-only` hosts.
- Some reflection subtests still fail (`col.span`, `progress.max`, `meter`, `textarea.rows`/`cols`, `pre.width`), as
  do 30 in the tentative ARIA test.
- Conformance outside the directories above has not been measured or improved, and other missing features have not
  been implemented.
- Nothing here has been reviewed by the upstream Servo maintainers.
